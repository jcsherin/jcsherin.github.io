## Introduction

Welcome back to our series on record shredding! In previous posts, we laid the groundwork by exploring the core
challenge of representing **nested data** efficiently in columnar storage and introduced **Dremel's revolutionary
solution**, leveraging definition and repetition levels. Today, we're taking a deep dive into **denester**, a Rust
implementation that brings Dremel's powerful concepts to life.

The seemingly straightforward task of implementing Dremel's shredding algorithm, especially when dealing with the subtle
but critical nuances of **missing or sparse values**, presents unique difficulties. It's not just about traversing a
tree; it's about correctly inferring and injecting "null" values and maintaining order. Our solution to this complexity
lies in a robust, decoupled **iterator and state machine** architecture, which we'll unpack in detail.

## The denester Blueprint: Schema and Values

Before we shred, we need a clear understanding of what we're shredding. denester relies on explicit representations for
both the data's structure (schema) and its content (values).

### Schema Definition

The schema defines the structure of your nested data. In denester, this is primarily managed through the `DataType` and
`Field` enums.

Here's a concise look at the `DataType` enum:

```rust
// src/field.rs
pub enum DataType {
  // ... basic types like Int32, ByteArray, etc.
  Group(Schema), // For nested structs/groups
  List(Box<Field>), // For repeated fields/lists
}
```

Building a schema is intuitive with SchemaBuilder:

```rust
// src/schema.rs or tests/schema.rs
use denester::schema::{Schema, SchemaBuilder, Field, DataType};

let schema = SchemaBuilder::new()
.add_field(Field::new("id", DataType::Int32, false))
.add_field(Field::new("name", DataType::ByteArray, false))
.add_field(Field::new("addresses", DataType::List(Box::new(
Field::new("list", DataType::Group(
SchemaBuilder::new()
.add_field(Field::new("street", DataType::ByteArray, false))
.add_field(Field::new("zip", DataType::Int32, true)) // Optional field
.build()
), false)
)), true)) // Optional list
.build();
```

### Value Representation

Input data is represented using the Value enum, which can encapsulate primitives, nested structs, or lists.

A concise code snippet for the Value enum:

```rust
// src/value.rs
pub enum Value {
  Null,
  Bool(bool),
  Int32(i32),
  // ... other primitive types
  Group(HashMap<String, Value>), // For structs/objects
  List(Vec<Value>), // For arrays/lists
}
```

Creating complex nested data with ValueBuilder is straightforward:

```rust
// src/value.rs or benches/shredder.rs
use denester::value::{Value, ValueBuilder};

let nested_value = ValueBuilder::group()
.field("id", Value::Int32(1))
.field("name", Value::ByteArray(b"Alice".to_vec()))
.field("addresses", Value::List(vec![
  ValueBuilder::group()
    .field("street", Value::ByteArray(b"123 Main St".to_vec()))
    .field("zip", Value::Int32(12345))
    .build(),
  ValueBuilder::group()
    .field("street", Value::ByteArray(b"456 Oak Ave".to_vec()))
    // zip is missing here, important for testing missing data!
    .build(),
]))
.build();
```

### The Core Problem: Beyond Simple Recursive Traversal

While simple recursive approaches excel at basic tree traversal, Dremel shredding, especially with sparse data, presents
a significant challenge. A naive recursion falls short for several reasons:

Generating nulls for missing optional fields: If an optional field is absent in the input, Dremel requires a "null"
value with specific definition and repetition levels. A simple recursion won't naturally generate these.

Handling empty repeated lists: An empty list should still produce a record with appropriate levels, not just be skipped.

Maintaining correct output order: When we inject these "synthetic" nulls, they must appear in the correct columnar order
relative to the actual present values.

This highlights that a more explicit state management and output buffering strategy is absolutely required. We need
fine-grained control over when values are emitted and when missing paths are accounted for.

### ValueParser: The Iterative State Machine

Enter ValueParser, the central component responsible for shredding. It's not just a parser; it's an iterative state
machine designed to navigate the complexities of Dremel.

#### High-Level Architecture

ValueParser decouples the traversal of the input Value from the processing and emission of shredded records.

value_iter (DepthFirstValueIterator): This component is the source of present input values. It performs a depth-first
traversal of the Value tree.

work_queue: This is the crucial element for decoupling. It acts as an internal buffer for items that are ready to be
processed and emitted, including both actual values and generated "missing" values.

Here's a glimpse into the ValueParser and WorkItem definitions:

```rust
// src/parser.rs
pub struct ValueParser {
  // ...
  value_iter: DepthFirstValueIterator,
  work_queue: VecDeque<WorkItem>, // Crucial for buffering and ordering
  // ...
}

pub enum WorkItem {
  Value(Value),
  MissingField(Field), // Represents a schema field that was missing in the input
  // ... other internal states
}
```

### State Management: Knowing Where You Are (and What's Missing)

To correctly compute definition and repetition levels, ValueParser meticulously tracks its position within the schema
and input data using several internal context structures, managed on internal stacks.

- `LevelContext`: This context accumulates the definition and repetition levels as the parser descends into the nested
  structure. It's fundamental for Dremel's output.

```rust
// src/parser.rs
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct LevelContext {
  pub def_level: i32,
  pub rep_level: i32,
  // ... other context for the current level
}
```

- `RepetitionContext`: This specifically tracks positions within lists (repeated fields). It helps determine when a new
  repetition level is needed.

```rust
// src/parser.rs
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct RepetitionContext {
  pub current_index: usize,
  pub total_items: usize,
  // ...
}
```

- `StructContext`: This manages the schema fields at the current structural depth (within a struct or group), which is
  vital for identifying missing fields.

These contexts are pushed onto and popped from internal stacks as the ValueParser traverses the input data, providing a
precise understanding of the current shredding context.

# Handling Missing Data: The "Unhappy Path"

This is where denester truly shines. Correctly handling missing or sparse data is paramount for Dremel's guarantees.

-----

## Identifying Gaps

As **ValueParser** traverses the actual input **Value** using `value_iter`, it constantly compares the present data
against the defined schema. The `buffer_missing_paths` mechanism identifies schema-defined fields that are absent in the
input value at the current structural level.

-----

## Strategic Buffering

Crucially, these identified missing paths are **buffered** rather than immediately queued for processing. Why? Because
their exact position in the output stream depends on the traversal. If we immediately queued them, they might appear out
of order relative to sibling fields that are present.

-----

## Queuing Logic on Traversal Backtrack: The Key Insight

The pivotal insight is that buffered missing paths are pushed to the `work_queue` only when `value_iter` signals a
transition to a sibling or an ancestor. This indicates that all children of the current node have been processed (or
accounted for as missing), and it's time to emit any pending missing fields for that level before moving to the next
sibling or ascending the tree.

This ensures that "synthetic" nulls for missing optional fields are correctly interleaved with actual data, maintaining
the precise columnar order required by Dremel.

```rust
// Simplified logic from ValueParser::next demonstrating buffering and conditional queuing
// This is illustrative and not direct code, as the actual logic is more intricate.
match value_iter.next() {
Some(TraversalEvent::Descend { value, field_name, field_schema }) => {
// ... push context onto stacks ...
// Check for missing fields within 'value' based on 'field_schema'
let missing_fields = self.find_missing_paths(value, field_schema);
self.buffered_missing.extend(missing_fields);
self.work_queue.push_back(WorkItem::Value(value)); // Process the present value
}
Some(TraversalEvent::Ascend { .. }) | Some(TraversalEvent::NextSibling { .. }) => {
// When ascending or moving to a sibling, now is the time to
// inject buffered missing fields into the work_queue
while let Some(missing_field) = self.buffered_missing.pop_front() {
self.work_queue.push_front(WorkItem::MissingField(missing_field));
}
// ... pop context from stacks ...
}
// ...
}
```

-----

## The `next()` Method: Orchestrating the Shredding

The **ValueParser** implements the `Iterator` trait, making it a highly ergonomic way to consume shredded records. Its
`next()` method is the heart of the orchestration.

### Iterator Implementation

By implementing `Iterator<Item = ShreddedRecord>`, **ValueParser** allows you to simply call `parser.next()` to get the
next shredded piece of data (value, definition level, repetition level).

### The Main Loop

The control flow within `ValueParser::next()` is carefully designed:

* **Prioritize `work_queue`**: The parser first checks its `work_queue`. If there are items (either actual values or
  buffered missing fields), it processes the next one and returns the corresponding shredded record. This ensures that
  previously identified and buffered missing fields are emitted at the correct time.
* **Pull from `value_iter` if `work_queue` is empty**: If the `work_queue` is empty, it means all pending items have
  been processed. The parser then pulls the next present value (or traversal event) from `value_iter`.
* **Conditional Buffering/Queuing**: Based on the `TraversalEvent` from `value_iter` (descending into a new field,
  ascending, or moving to a sibling):
  * **Descending**: The parser might identify new missing paths and buffer them. The present value is typically
    immediately added to the `work_queue`.
  * **Backtracking (Ascending or NextSibling)**: This is the critical moment. Any previously buffered missing paths that
    are now "complete" (i.e., we've fully processed or visited all children of the current node) are moved from the
    internal buffer to the **front** of the `work_queue`. This ensures they are processed before moving further up the
    tree or to the next sibling, maintaining correct order.

Here's a simplified, high-level view of `ValueParser::next`'s loop:

```rust
// Simplified high-level pseudo-code for ValueParser::next()
impl Iterator for ValueParser {
  type Item = ShreddedRecord; // (Value, DefLevel, RepLevel)

  fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
    // 1. Prioritize work_queue
    if let Some(work_item) = self.work_queue.pop_front() {
      return self.process_work_item(work_item); // Process and return shredded record
    }

    // 2. If work_queue is empty, pull from value_iter
    loop {
      match self.value_iter.next()? { // Get next event from the actual value traversal
        TraversalEvent::Descend { value, field_schema, .. } => {
          // Update contexts (def/rep levels, struct context)
          self.update_contexts_for_descent(field_schema);

          // Find and buffer any missing fields based on schema and 'value'
          let missing = self.find_missing_paths(&value, field_schema);
          self.buffered_missing.extend(missing);

          // Add the present value to the work queue to be processed
          self.work_queue.push_back(WorkItem::Value(value));
          break; // Exit loop, process work_queue on next `next()` call
        }
        TraversalEvent::Ascend { .. } | TraversalEvent::NextSibling { .. } => {
          // Update contexts (pop levels)
          self.update_contexts_for_ascend();

          // If ascending or moving to a sibling, inject buffered missing fields
          // for the current level to the *front* of the work_queue
          while let Some(missing_field) = self.buffered_missing.pop_front() {
            self.work_queue.push_front(WorkItem::MissingField(missing_field));
          }

          // If work_queue now has items, break to process them.
          // Otherwise, continue loop to get next value_iter event.
          if !self.work_queue.is_empty() {
            break;
          }
        }
        // ... other traversal events
      }
    }

    // After the loop, the work_queue should have items to process.
    // Recursively call next() to process the now-populated work_queue,
    // ensuring the first item is emitted.
    self.next()
  }
}
```

## Putting It All Together: A Concrete Example

Let's illustrate denester's power with a real test case that specifically demonstrates handling missing data within a
repeated struct. We'll use a simplified version of `test_repeated_struct_with_missing_values` from `tests/parser.rs`.

### Illustrative Test Case

Consider this schema for a document with optional tags:

```json
{
  "name": "doc",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "id",
      "type": "INT32",
      "repetition": "REQUIRED",
      "def_level": 0,
      "rep_level": 0
    },
    {
      "name": "tags",
      "type": "LIST",
      "repetition": "OPTIONAL",
      "def_level": 1,
      "rep_level": 0,
      "children": [
        {
          "name": "list",
          "type": "GROUP",
          "repetition": "REPEATED",
          "def_level": 2,
          "rep_level": 1,
          "children": [
            {
              "name": "name",
              "type": "BYTE_ARRAY",
              "repetition": "REQUIRED",
              "def_level": 2,
              "rep_level": 2
            },
            {
              "name": "value",
              "type": "BYTE_ARRAY",
              "repetition": "OPTIONAL",
              "def_level": 3,
              "rep_level": 2
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Input and Expected Output

Input JSON (represented as `denester::Value`):

```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "tags": [
    {
      "name": "tagA",
      "value": "val1"
    },
    {
      "name": "tagB"
    },
    // "value" field is missing here
    {
      "name": "tagC",
      "value": "val3"
    }
  ]
}
```

Expected Shredded Output (Value, Def Level, Rep Level):

```
(123,           1, 0)  // id
(b"tagA",      3, 0)  // tags.list.name
(b"val1",      3, 0)  // tags.list.value
(b"tagB",      3, 1)  // tags.list.name
(NULL,          2, 1)  // tags.list.value (missing, note def_level decreased)
(b"tagC",      3, 1)  // tags.list.name
(b"val3",      3, 1)  // tags.list.value
```

### Walkthrough

1. **id**: Processed first, straightforward.
2. **tags (list start)**: **ValueParser** descends into the tags list.
3. **tags[0] (tagA)**:

* **name**: "tagA" is processed.
* **value**: "val1" is processed.

4. **tags[1] (tagB)**:

* **name**: "tagB" is processed (repetition level increments as it's a new element in the list).
* Now, the **ValueParser** notices that the `value` field is missing for `tagB` in the input **Value**. It identifies
  this gap against the schema.
* It buffers this missing `value` field internally.
* As the `value_iter` signals it's moving from `tagB` to `tagC` (a sibling), the buffered `value` missing field is
  pushed to the **front** of the `work_queue`.
* When `ValueParser::next()` is called again, it prioritizes the `work_queue` and emits `(NULL, 2, 1)` for the missing
  `value` field. The definition level `2` correctly indicates that the optional `value` field itself is missing, but its
  parent list and group are present.

5. **tags[2] (tagC)**:

* **name**: "tagC" is processed.
* **value**: "val3" is processed.

This example clearly shows how **ValueParser** strategically buffers and then emits nulls for missing optional fields at
precisely the right moment, ensuring columnar correctness.

```rust
// tests/parser.rs - (Simplified and illustrative snippet)
#[test]
fn test_repeated_struct_with_missing_values() {
  let schema = SchemaBuilder::new()
    .add_field(Field::new("id", DataType::Int32, false))
    .add_field(Field::new("tags", DataType::List(Box::new(
      Field::new("list", DataType::Group(
        SchemaBuilder::new()
          .add_field(Field::new("name", DataType::ByteArray, false))
          .add_field(Field::new("value", DataType::ByteArray, true)) // Optional value
          .build()
      ), false)
    )), true))
    .build();

  let input_value = ValueBuilder::group()
    .field("id", Value::Int32(123))
    .field("tags", Value::List(vec![
      ValueBuilder::group()
        .field("name", Value::ByteArray(b"tagA".to_vec()))
        .field("value", Value::ByteArray(b"val1".to_vec()))
        .build(),
      ValueBuilder::group()
        .field("name", Value::ByteArray(b"tagB".to_vec()))
        .build(), // Missing "value" field
      ValueBuilder::group()
        .field("name", Value::ByteArray(b"tagC".to_vec()))
        .field("value", Value::ByteArray(b"val3".to_vec()))
        .build(),
    ]))
    .build();

  let mut parser = ValueParser::new(&input_value, &schema);

  let expected_output = vec![
    // (Value, Def Level, Rep Level)
    (Value::Int32(123), 1, 0),  // id
    (Value::ByteArray(b"tagA".to_vec()), 3, 0),  // tags.list.name
    (Value::ByteArray(b"val1".to_vec()), 3, 0),  // tags.list.value
    (Value::ByteArray(b"tagB".to_vec()), 3, 1),  // tags.list.name
    (Value::Null, 2, 1),  // tags.list.value (missing)
    (Value::ByteArray(b"tagC".to_vec()), 3, 1),  // tags.list.name
    (Value::ByteArray(b"val3".to_vec()), 3, 1),  // tags.list.value
  ];

  for (expected_value, expected_def, expected_rep) in expected_output {
    let (shredded_value, def_level, rep_level) = parser.next().unwrap();
    assert_eq!(shredded_value, expected_value);
    assert_eq!(def_level, expected_def);
    assert_eq!(rep_level, expected_rep);
  }
  assert!(parser.next().is_none()); // Ensure no more values
}
```

## Conclusion

denester's Rust implementation provides a robust and correct solution for "shredding" complex, sparse nested data,
directly addressing the intricate challenges posed by Dremel's algorithm. The chosen architecture, featuring a decoupled
**DepthFirstValueIterator**, an explicit state machine within **ValueParser**, and the strategic use of a `work_queue`,
ensures:

* **Robustness**: It handles arbitrary nesting and complex scenarios, including deeply nested optional and repeated
  fields.
* **Correctness**: It accurately computes definition and repetition levels, crucially inserting "synthetic" nulls for
  missing data in the correct order.
* **Maintainability**: The separation of concerns between traversal and processing, along with clear state management,
  makes the codebase understandable and extendable.

This pattern of using a decoupled iterator and an explicit state machine with a work queue is not unique to record
shredding. It holds significant value for other complex tree transformations and data processing pipelines in Rust,
where fine-grained control over output order and the handling of inferred or synthetic data is required.
