title: "The Clever Design in Apache Parquet For Storing Nested Data Efficiently In Columns"
date: 2025-06-24
summary: >
  Parquet uses the Dremel representation. Under the hood it derives two metadata columns for each value. This post
  is not simply about how to compute the metadata. It is complicated, but mechanical once you understand the core
  algorithm. The interesting part involves the challenges which are unique to nested data structures, and marvel
  at the elegance of the Dremel representation.
